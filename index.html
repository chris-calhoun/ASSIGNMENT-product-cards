            The first iPod had a monochrome LCD (liquid-crystal display) screen
            and featured a 5GB hard drive capable of storing 1,000 songs encoded
            using MP3 and was priced at US$399. Among the iPod's innovations
            were its small size, achieved using a 1.8" hard drive, whereas its
            competitors were using 2.5" hard drives at the time, and its
            easy-to-use navigation, which was controlled using a mechanical
            scroll wheel (unlike later iPods, which had touch-sensitive scroll
            wheels), a center select button, and four auxiliary buttons around
            the wheel. The iPod had a rated battery life of ten hours.

            The second-generation of the iPod was introduced on July 17, 2002.
            Using a similar body style as the first generation, the top of the
            iPod was redesigned, switching from a single swooping cutout in the
            backplate to mount the FireWire port, hold switch and headphone
            assembly, to individual ports being cut into the backplate to allow
            these ports to be accessed. Furthermore, the hold switch was
            redesigned, a cover was added to the FireWire port, and the
            mechanical wheel was replaced with a touch-sensitive wheel.

            On April 29, 2003, Apple announced a completely redesigned
            third-generation iPod. Thinner than the previous models, the
            third-generation models replaced the FireWire port with a new Dock
            Connector and introduced the Touch Wheel, a completely
            non-mechanical interface with the four auxiliary buttons located in
            a row between the screen and the touch wheel. The front plate had
            rounded edges, and the rear casing was slightly rounded as well. A
            new wired remote connector was introduced.

            Announced on July 19, 2004, the fourth-generation iPod replaced the
            touch wheel from the third-generation iPod with the Click Wheel from
            the iPod Mini, putting the four auxiliary buttons underneath a
            touch-sensitive scroll wheel. The casing was also slightly slimmer.
            Pricing was reduced and the lineup was simplified, as the 20GB model
            was sold for US$299 and the 40GB model for US$399. Notably, Apple
            began reducing pack-in accessories starting with the fourth
            generation.
